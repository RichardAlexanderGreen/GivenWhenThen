    <heading>Given When Then - at Three Levels</heading>
    <p>
       The Given-When-Then style of writing requirements clarifies thinking.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The "Given" defines the preconditions that hold before an event or operation.
        <li>The "When" identifies an event or operation
       <li>The "Then" identifies the post conditions that hold after the event or operation.  
      </ul>
    
    <p>We can apply Given-When-Then at three levels of requirements writing.
        </p>

    <ol>
      <li>the business events (business behavior) involved at the highest level (organization/user actor),
      <li>the user interface for business process proxies, and
      <li>the specific code behavior at the unit-test level (robot actor).
    </ol>
    
<pre>
<b>At the business process level,</b>
Given: [business goal / strategy]
 When: [business process / event]
 Then: [desired business behavior]       (This can be tested by a process audit.)

<b>At the user-interface level . . .</b>
Given: [user-interface context / mode]
 When: [user action]
 Then: [system response]                 (This can be tested through the UI. )

<b>At the robot / computer level . . .</b>
Given: [system state]
 When: [system event / input / additional state]
 Then: [expected system post-condition]  (This can be tested at Unit Test level)
</pre>

    <section>
       <heading>Business Process Level</heading>
        <p>
      At the business process level, 
      our focus is on describing the business context of a set of requirements.
      Here is the template for process goals:
    </p>
<pre>
Given: [business process goal / strategy]
 When: [business process / event]
 Then: [desired business behavior]      
</pre>
    <p>Here is an example:
       </p>
<pre>
Given: The survey (ballot) is published (on-line); 
       and, the survey (voting) period is in-progress. 
 When: A respondent (voter) enters a vote on a ballot item.
 Then: That vote is tallied.
 Then: The vote is secret. (It can be authenticated. But, it cannot be traced.)
 Then: The voter can audit (verify that their entry is in the collection).
</pre>
   <p>This level of specification does not result in an automated test.
      It can be tested. But, the test typically involves some kind of audit.
     </p>

    <section>
       <heading>Interface Level</heading>

        <p>The interface level requirement identifies the interaction between actors.
           Typically, one actor is a user and the second actor is the system.
       In enterprise integration contexts, 
      the two actors may be two robots (applications)
      where each robot is the proxy (automated interface) for a business process.
           The interface is typically a screen with a keyboard,
       but other architectures are possible.
       Here is the template for interface level specification.
    </p>
<pre>
Given: [user-interface context / mode]
 When: [user action]
 Then: [system response]                
</pre>
      <p>Here is an example that follows on the business process above:
       </p>
<pre>
Given: The user is signed-in and authenticated 
         and has navigated to the survey (ballot) pane.
 When: The question is a proposal.
 Then: The allowed responses are Yes, No, and Abstain. 
         Abstain is the default value.              
</pre>
    <p>Note that this describes the expected interaction 
      without describing how it will be implemented.
       The test could be manual. 
       The tester would simply try out the user interface
         and confirm that the possible responses were Yes, No, and Abstain.
       </p>
      <p>But we cannot write an automated test 
      without knowing a great deal about the design.
       However, the design could be indicated with Given-When-Then also.  
       </p>
<pre>
Given: A ballot or survey represented in XML.
 When: The ballot contains a proposal.
 Then: The XML representation includes the form: 
         "&lt;proposal&gt;proposal text&lt;/proposal&gt;". 
 Then: The interface-builder (component) will generate interface code (HTML) 
         from the XML.
</pre>
    <p>At this point, 
         a competent programmer can write code that conforms to this design.
       The executable test might look like this (Smalltalk):
       </p>
<pre>
test1234ballotProposalXMLGeneratesHTML
  "The allowed responses for a proposal are Yes, No, and Abstain."
  | ballot ballotElement proposalElement html |
  self given: [ ballot := XML element: 'ballot' 
                                 with: [ XML element: 'proposal' 
                                                with: ['proposal text'].
                                       ].
                "configuration comes from setUp"
                builder := configuration interfaceBuilder. 
                
              ]
        when: [ ballotElement := ballot nextElement.
                proposalElement := ballotElement nextElement.
                self assert: ( proposalElement isType: 'proposal' ).
                html := builder buildHTMLfrom: proposalElement.
              ]
        then: [ self assert: ( html includes: 'Yes' ).
                self assert: ( html includes: 'No' ).
                self assert: ( html includes: 'Abstain' ).
              ].
</pre>
     <p>Of course, we don't know if the HTML generated will actually execute correctly.
        This test only confirms that the generated code contains the words we expect.
        We also don't know if the widget will be a radio button group or a drop-down.
        But that is a good thing. We don't want to have too much test all in one place.
     </p>
